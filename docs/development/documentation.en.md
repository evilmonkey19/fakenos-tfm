# Documentation

## Multi-language support
In order to have the documentation written in multiple language a mkdocs plugins is being used. Perhaps you have already seen a strange format in the docs. We use a plugin that indicates the language file to be used based on the suffix of the file. For example, if you want to write a documentation in Spanish, you should create a file with the suffix `.es.md` and the plugin will automatically use the Spanish language file.
